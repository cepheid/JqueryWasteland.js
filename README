RANDOM JQUERY-BASED JAVASCRIPT SNIPPETS

PLEASE NOTE: This JQUERY is from long, long ago, and a galaxy far, far away. A lot of these actions have been deprecated.

NOTE: This is a series of JQuery-based functions (some including plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML as needed) I've used that accomplished what I needed to accomplish.

This code is not intended to be used as-is, only as an example of JQuery that worked at least once before! If you learn JQuery by example (as I typically do), you may find some of these functions helpful, and are certainly welcome to optimize them if you can.

There is no license for use, feel free to use under any circumstance and modify at will.
